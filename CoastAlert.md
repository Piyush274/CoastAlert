# 🌊 Integrated Platform for Crowdsourced Ocean Hazard Reporting & Social Media Analytics

## 📌 Overview
This project proposes a unified platform for **real-time crowdsourced ocean hazard reporting** and **social media analytics** to enhance coastal safety and disaster risk reduction.  
It is developed under the guidance of **[Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS)](https://incois.gov.in/)**, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India.

## 🏢 About INCOIS
The **Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS)** provides **ocean information and advisory services** to support **disaster risk reduction** and **maritime safety** for coastal stakeholders.  
Its early warning services cover:

- 🌊 **Tsunamis**
- 🌪️ **Storm Surges**
- 🌐 **High Waves & Swell Surges**
- 🌀 **Coastal Currents**

These warnings enable authorities and communities to make **informed decisions** during ocean-related emergencies.

---

## 🌍 Background
India’s **7,500+ km long coastline** faces multiple ocean-related hazards like **tsunamis, storm surges, high waves, coastal flooding, and abnormal sea behavior**.  

While agencies like INCOIS provide **scientific early warnings** using **satellite data, sensors, and numerical models**, there are two key gaps:
1. **Delayed or missing real-time field reports** from citizens and local communities.
2. **Untapped social media insights** that could provide on-ground realities, public awareness, and information spread during hazard events.

This project addresses both gaps by combining **crowdsourced reporting** with **social media analytics**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Citizens and coastal communities **lack a direct platform** to report real-time hazards.
- Social media discussions during disasters **remain unstructured and underutilized**.
- Authorities require a **unified dashboard** to combine citizen reports and social media insights for **faster decision-making**.

---

## 🚀 Proposed Solution
An **integrated platform** (mobile + web) that empowers **citizens, coastal residents, volunteers, and disaster managers** to:
- Report **real-time hazard observations** (tides, flooding, damage, tsunamis, high waves, etc.).
- Access a **live dashboard** showing verified reports and social media trends.
- Use **AI-powered analytics** to understand discussions, sentiments, and hotspots.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 📱 **Crowdsourced Reporting**
- Submit **geotagged reports** with photos/videos via mobile or web.
- Offline data collection with **sync later** support for remote areas.
- Multilingual support for accessibility across coastal regions.

### 🗺️ **Dynamic Visualization**
- Interactive **map-based dashboard** showing real-time reports.
- **Hotspot generation** based on:
  - Report density
  - Keyword frequency
  - Verified incident markers

### 📊 **Social Media Analytics**
- Integration with **Twitter**, **public Facebook posts**, **YouTube comments**, etc.
- **NLP-powered text classification** to extract:
  - Hazard-related discussions
  - Trending topics
  - Sentiment analysis

### 🧠 **Role-Based Access**
- **Citizens** → Submit observations.
- **Disaster Managers** → Validate reports.
- **Analysts** → Monitor insights and trends.
